For example:\n\n- A website or web app  \n- A mobile application  \n- A desktop application  \n- A specific feature or screen (e.g., login page, dashboard, settings menu)  \n\nLet me know your goals—like better usability, modern aesthetics, accessibility, responsiveness, or performance—and I’d be happy to help! 😊",
