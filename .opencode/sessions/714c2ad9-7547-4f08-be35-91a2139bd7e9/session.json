The user might be testing if I can understand Chinese greetings, or they simply want to greet me.\n\nI should:\n1. Greet them back (in Chinese, since they greeted me in Chinese)\n2. Introduce myself briefly\n3. Offer to help them with whatever they need\n\nLet me keep it friendly and concise since this is just a greeting.\n</think>\n你好！👋 \n\n你好！I'm MiniMax-M2.1, ready to help! ✨\n\nHow can I assist you today?
